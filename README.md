# Machine Learning â€“ Optimization & Eigenfaces

This project contains my solutions to a machine learning assignment that explores:
- **Optimization & derivatives** for functions of multiple variables  
- **Gradient Descent** implementation from scratch in Python  
- **Face Recognition with Eigenfaces** (PCA + Nearest Neighbor)  

The notebook includes:
1. **Derivatives & Optimization**  
   - Matrix calculus with step-by-step derivations  
   - Analytical solutions for optimization problems  

2. **Gradient Descent**  
   - Implementation from scratch in NumPy  
   - Experiments with constant and variable learning rates  
   - Visualization of cost function convergence and fitted models  

3. **Face Recognition with Eigenfaces**  
   - PCA feature extraction from the Yale B face dataset  
   - Eigenfaces visualization and image reconstruction  
   - Face classification using k-Nearest Neighbor in eigenspace  
   - Analysis of recognition performance for varying number of components
   - 
## Results

- Gradient Descent converges successfully with appropriate learning rates.
- Eigenfaces demonstrate how PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction and face recognition under varying lighting conditions.

## Disclaimer

This notebook was originally part of a university assignment, but is published here only for portfolio and learning purposes.
